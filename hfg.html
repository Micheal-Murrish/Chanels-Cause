                    Heart Family Group was set up by Chanel’s mum, Fay, in 2014 with an aim to connect parents and patients 
                    affected by Congenital Heart Defects to support each other. Shortly joined by fellow heart parents 
                    Chanel Crane, Laura Lane and Gemma Kier.

                    Fay- ‘When Chanel was born we made the most amazing friendships with other families, it was the support 
                    from people who understood I needed. When we got home for the first time at 3 month old, I missed the 
                    support and them friendship’s’ - and so the Heart Family Group was born. Wanting all families to have support 
                    from others who can truly understand and in similar situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heart Family Group has a private support group on Facebook, connecting families on social media. When 
                    possible we also try to organise annual meets ups too, usually at Alton Towers. This is always a magical 
                    experience for families to meet up with others and can be beneficial for the children aswell as the 
                    parents, most importantly meeting outside of hospital to just have fun with others that understand.
