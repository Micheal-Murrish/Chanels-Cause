            <h1>Christmas Campaign</h1>
            <p>
                Every Christmas Eve for the last 8 years, Chanel's Cause has fundraised separately on top of everything else 
                to raise enough to personally take in gifts to children and families in hospital too poorly to make it home 
                over the festive season, as well as NHS who are working over it. Deliveries of gifts, hampers, food, mascots and 
                so much more are delivered in the hope of bringing some extra Christmas magic to the wards on a special time for 
                all but still a difficult time for so many.
                <br>
                <br>
                Every Christmas Eve the family spend the morning lightening up ward 23 and the paediatric intensive care unit 
                of Newcastle Freeman Hospital cardiac unit. Many of the children on the unit are longer term patients due to the 
                severity of their conditions and as it is such a specialist unit many are also many miles from home. 
                Personally, knowing too well what it’s like to spend long periods of times in hospital, but we can only imagine 
                how difficult it must be over Christmas. Chanel and her brothers hand out hundreds of pounds (sometimes thousands) of 
                gifts to the children around the unit. We are usually always accompanied by mascots to bring some extra festive 
                cheer (Chanel loves dressing up herself too). We also give gifts to siblings, handy gifts like cups with lids etc 
                to use on the unit for parents. Gifts for all the staff working. Bags full of shopping to fill up the kitchen on 
                the ward for families to help themselves to, as well as a festive spread of sandwiches and picky food to enjoy. 
                Finally, updates to the ward playroom with new computer consoles, xbox’s, Nintendo, switches, games, portable dvd 
                players and so much more. It’s our very own Chanel's Cause very special Christmas giving tradition, that we 
                believe helps so much.
