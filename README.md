### HTML AND CSS Testing.

2. [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for the CSS.

All issues foud where fixed apart from on the CSS, i was getting this error message"Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes" and upon investigation i found it to be that W3C just wont validate the imported style sheets.

## Known bugs/issues

1. Nav bar and banner image shrink with screen size making it look two small on mobile devices.
2. My mentor pointed out my git commit messages where not good enough, i understand now and will make them more specific in the future


## Problems I could not solve
1. Tried to add a sticky nav bar so you could access the nav without scrolling up the page.
    * For some reason it just never worked, i tried stack overflow and also watched Youtube videos on the subject but still got no further forward.
2. Tried to add a hamburger menu for mobile platform for the nav bar
    * My mentor showed me a way to implement a hamburger menu for mobile devices, ws a very good idea and something i will add later, but i could not get it to look nice on my site, maybe after the JavaScript side of the course it will make more sence.
