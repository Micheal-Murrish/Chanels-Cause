                   Over the years Chanel's Cause has raised over £10,000 to date for <a href="https://www.chuf.org.uk/about/heart-heroes/" class="link-in-text" target="_blank">CHUF</a>, 
                   The children’s Heart Unit Fund at the 
                   Freeman Hospital specialist unit in Newcastle. Providing lifesaving equipment for children born with complex 
                   congenital heart defects or requiring transplants. Funds were raised through numerous ways. Chanel took part 
                   in a charity catwalk, only weeks after learning to walk with help from a leg splint after suffering
                   a stroke - but has sold SO many charity bracelets and even managed to grab the attention of some celebrities 
                   to help. She and her brothers have took part in numerous sponsored walks over the years and even managed to 
                   get local schools to hold ‘wear red days’ to help raise funds. In addition funds have been raised through 
                   Christmas card sales and so much more! The Cause also has had numerous participants take part in the Greta 
                   North Run each year.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Chanel has also helped raised into the hundreds of thousands of pounds and rising for the 
                   <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2021/january/research-in-newcastle-to-further-study-the-role-of-genes-in-congenital-heart-defects" class="link-in-text" target="_blank">British Heart Foundation</a>. 
                   She has travelled to London numerous times for photo shoots and filming and featured in many of their campaigns. 
                   She has a brilliant relationship with the BHF team and shares her story whenever she can to help both raise funds 
                   and awareness. For extra fundraising sales from BHF calendars has been sent to the charity for multiple years to 
                   support The British Heart Foundation in their incredible work and research into heart conditions.

                <p>
                   Chanel's Cause has had amazing help over the years from local buisness's in raising funds to support other 
                   charities and their <a href="campaign.html" class="link-in-text"> Christmas Campaign</a>. From charity buckets in numerous places to venues holding charity 
                   event nights.>
                </p>
                <p>
                   Every Christmas Eve for the last 8 years, Chanel's Cause has fundraised separately on top of everything else to 
                   raise enough to personally take in gifts to children and families in hospital too poorly to make it home over 
                   the festive season, as well as NHS who are working over it. The family delivers gifts, hampers, food, mascots 
                   and so much more in the hope of bringing some extra Christmas magic to the wards on a special time for all but 
                   still a difficult time for so many.

                <p>
                   Chanels journey has been shared through social media since she was born (please see social media links at the 
                   bottom of the webpage), now she is older she regularly helps update it herself. She also speaks to local and 
                   national media regularly, raising much needed awareness of heart conditions especially in children and young 
                   people. Hoping to raise awareness and impact on the importance of organ donation too.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Finally, a support group on social media was also set up in 2014, the <a href="hfg.html" class="link-in-text">Heart Family Group</a>. With the aim to connect 
                   other families with similar conditions for support. They also try to maintain yearly meet ups in person which 
                   can be beneficial to both the parents and children affected by CHD's.
